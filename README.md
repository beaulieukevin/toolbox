# What is it?

Toolbox is a Windows Command Line Interface (CLI) allowing organizations to create, customize, centralize and scale common local environment configurations using their own source control management system through scripting.

It provides multiple advantages:

* No need of prerequired software, executable, framework or tool to setup Toolbox. Only a plain vanilla Windows operating system having PowerShell 5.1 minimum.
* The centralization of all configurations and installation scripts in a source control management system allowing better security audit.
* The possibility to install tools and software in a portable way without the interaction with the direct operating system directories.
* The analysis of the usage of Toolbox within your organization through analytics.
* The promotion of inner source collaboration within your development teams.

> Toolbox is under analysis to be used under Mac OS and Linux operating systems but is still not yet available. ‚≠ê the repository to be kept up to date.

# How to Setup Toolbox?

The documentation has been splitted based on two roles:

* [As a Toolbox user](/docs/README-user.md), the person who wants to use Toolbox within their development environment.
* [As a Toolbox administrator](/docs/README-admin.md), the person who is responsible of configuring and updating Toolbox for his colleagues.

Depending on your role, read the appropriate documentation.
