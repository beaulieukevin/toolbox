# Introduction

As an end user, we assume you start from a plain vanilla Windows. Toolbox is coming with an embedded lightweight version of Git called [MinGit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases). The following sections will explain how to use Toolbox within your organization.

# Install Toolbox

1. **Download as ZIP** the source code of this repository.
2. **Extract the content** of the ZIP file in a directory in your working drive. We recommend you to name that directory `toolbox`.

At that stage you have downloaded and extracted the ZIP file into a directory in your working drive. For example: `R:\toolbox`. Make sure that all files are at the root of `toolbox` directory without any subdirectories that might come from the extraction. This is to ease URI simplification.

3. **Open `toolbox` directory** in which you have extracted Toolbox in your file explorer.
4. **Double click** on `setup.bat` to start Toolbox installation.

The installation of Toolbox will start. Follow the instructions and wait until the installation has finished. It will take around 1 minute.

# Check Toolbox Installation

Open a new command prompt and execute the following command:

```
toolbox version
```

You should see the current version of Toolbox being used.

# Read Manual Page

You have now Toolbox installed on your VDI. **Congratulations!**

Start reading the manual page. In a command prompt execute the following command:

```
toolbox help
```

# Congratulations

Toolbox is now installed on your local environment.
